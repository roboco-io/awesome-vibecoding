# Weekly README Update Prompt

You are updating the awesome-vibecoding README.md with the latest AI coding tools.

## Task

Research and update each section of the README with new tools using multiple sources and search strategies.

## Categories

1. **IDE & Editor Assistants** - AI-powered code completion and IDE integrations
2. **Agentic Coding Environments** - Autonomous AI systems for end-to-end development
3. **Cloud & Platform Integrations** - Browser-based and cloud AI development platforms
4. **MCP Servers & Tooling** - Model Context Protocol servers and related tools
5. **Learning Resources** - Research papers, articles, videos about vibe coding

## Multi-Source Research Strategy

### 1. Perplexity Search Queries (Use ALL of these)

For each category, run multiple targeted queries:

**General Discovery:**
- "new AI coding tools released 2025"
- "trending AI coding assistants January 2025"
- "best vibe coding tools 2025"

**Category-Specific (IDE & Editor):**
- "new VS Code AI extensions 2025"
- "Claude Code alternatives 2025"
- "AI coding CLI tools 2025"
- "terminal AI coding assistant"

**Category-Specific (Agentic):**
- "autonomous AI coding agents 2025"
- "AI software engineer tools like Devin"
- "open source AI coding agent"

**Category-Specific (Cloud):**
- "AI app builders like Bolt.new 2025"
- "no-code AI development platforms"

**Trending/Buzz:**
- "opencode AI coding" (example of trending tool)
- "what AI coding tools are developers using 2025"
- "AI coding tools trending on GitHub"
- "AI coding tools trending on Hacker News"

### 2. Community Signal Queries

Search for community discussions:
- "r/vibecoding new tools"
- "r/ClaudeAI alternatives"
- "r/ChatGPTCoding best tools 2025"
- "Hacker News AI coding tools"

### 3. GitHub Trending Check

Search for:
- "GitHub trending AI coding repositories this week"
- "most starred AI coding tools 2025"

## Process

For each category:

1. **Read current README.md section** - Know what's already listed
2. **Run ALL search queries** for that category
3. **Compile candidate list** - Extract tool names from all searches
4. **Verify each candidate:**
   - Has official website or GitHub repo
   - Is actively maintained (commits in last 3 months)
   - Has documentation
   - Has meaningful community adoption (stars, users)
5. **Add new entries** that meet criteria
6. **Update existing entries** if they have significant new features
7. **Flag discontinued tools** for human review (don't auto-remove)

## Entry Format

Follow the existing table format in README.md:

```markdown
| [**Tool Name**](url) | Short description (under 80 chars) |
```

## Quality Criteria

A tool should be added if it meets ANY of these:
- 1000+ GitHub stars
- Featured in major tech publications
- Active development (multiple releases in 2025)
- Mentioned in multiple community discussions
- Offers unique capability not covered by existing tools

## Known Gaps to Check

These tools are frequently discussed but may be missing:
- opencode (CLI AI coding agent)
- Aider (AI pair programming)
- Void (VS Code fork)
- Melty (AI coding assistant)
- Zed AI (Zed editor AI features)
- CodeGPT
- Codeium (standalone)

Search specifically for these and add if not present.

## Translation

After updating README.md, synchronize changes to:
- README.ko.md (Korean)
- README.ja.md (Japanese)

Use the /translate command after all changes are complete.

## Output

After completing the update, provide a summary:
1. Number of new tools added per category
2. List of new tools with brief justification
3. Any tools flagged for review
4. Any tools that were considered but not added (and why)
