# Weekly README Update Prompt

You are updating the awesome-vibecoding README.md with the latest AI coding tools.

## Task

Research and update each section of the README with new tools released in 2025.

## Categories

1. **IDE & Editor Assistants** - AI-powered code completion and IDE integrations
2. **Agentic Coding Environments** - Autonomous AI systems for end-to-end development
3. **Cloud & Platform Integrations** - Browser-based and cloud AI development platforms
4. **Learning Resources** - Research papers, articles, videos about vibe coding

## Process

For each category:

1. Use Perplexity to search: "latest AI coding tools 2025 [category name]"
2. Read the current README.md section
3. Compare search results with existing entries
4. Add new tools that meet criteria:
   - Released or significantly updated in 2025
   - Has official website or GitHub
   - Well-documented and actively maintained
   - Relevant to vibe coding / AI-assisted development
5. Update existing entries if they have new features
6. Flag discontinued tools for review (don't auto-remove)

## Format

New entries should follow this format:
```markdown
| **Tool Name** | Short description (under 60 chars) | [Website](url) |
```

## Translation

After updating README.md, synchronize changes to:
- README.ko.md (Korean)
- README.ja.md (Japanese)

Use the /translate command or manually add entries at the same position.

## Guidelines
